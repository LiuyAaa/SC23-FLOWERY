## Function
This file mainly to generate the result figure in a simple way.
    ```bash
    python GeneratePlot.py
    ```
After running this script, each benchmark will generate their own result figure called benchmark_graph.png. 

You can directly compare this figure with figure 17 within paper. If you want to know more detailed process, you can go to s5-cross-layer-evaluation and s7-evaluation section to run each sub script. The detailed steps can be found in Reproducing Paper Results section of README.md. Remember that to use our prepared reproducing python scripts, you may have to use the benchmark-name (in code) instead of that in the original paper. This also can be found in Benchmark Info section of README.md.
